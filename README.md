# Python for Metalheads: Katatonia Edition 🖤<br/>

## _"Hello, Quiet World."_<br/>

This repo is a collection of tiny Python programs inspired by my favorite band, Katatonia. Each one is a beginner-friendly exercise in Python basics, disguised as a bleak poem or hostile machine. Perfect for:<br/>

- People learning Python for the first time

- Metalheads & goths who want code as grim as their playlists

- Anyone who thinks print("Hello, World") is too cheerful<br/>

These scripts are designed as companions to my YouTube mini-series "Python for Metalheads", where I walk through each program step by step.<br/>

## ⚰️ Table of Contents

Beginner → Intermediate-Beginner progression:

- hello.py — Hello, Quiet World  

Concept: The Katatonia twist on the classic “Hello, World.”  

Skills: print()  

- bmday.py — Brave, Murder, Day Generator  

Concept: Random Katatonia lyric describes your day.

Skills: import random, random.choice()

- deliberation.py — The Infinite Loop  

Concept: Eternal cycle of love / no love.

Skills: while True, breaking infinite loops (learn Ctrl+C)

- codeagainst.py — The Error Generator  

Concept: Randomly crashes with a Katatonia-flavored exception.

Skills: raise, exceptions, random.choice()<br/>

## 🎃 Bonus Utilities

- katascii.py — Converts words into ASCII art using pyfiglet.

_Not part of the main learning arc, but perfect for making your terminal look like a metal flyer._<br/>

## 🔮 Planned Scripts

- ibreak.py — I Break

This one will “break” code intentionally.

- Ideas:

Write a function that raises multiple different errors, one after the other

Print fragmented strings that “cut off” mid-line

Or loop until it collapses with a RecursionError — literal broken recursion.

grimoire.py — Expanded from my earlier series

File-writing exercise where names are “bound” into a grimoire.

Will tie into future projects with file I/O.

## 🩸 How to Use

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/algosovabject/katatonia.git  
cd katatonia  

Run a program:

python3 hello.py


## ⚠️ Note: Some programs are intentionally hostile:

deliberation.py will run forever (press Ctrl+C to stop).

codeagainst.py will crash every time. This is the point.

## 📺 Watch the Series

Each script corresponds to a YouTube tutorial in the Python for Goths playlist.
👉 [Algos ov Abject on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@algosovabject)

The videos explain the code in detail, step by step, with atmospheric flair.
