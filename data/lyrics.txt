Human Birds Watch The Sky
Where Dark Formations Sail
Infecting The Area of God

I Am God Creator of Life
I Am God Enchanter of Death
Death That Now Marks You
Life That Slowly Pass Away

Screams of Fear Dismembering The Wind
Helpless Souls Drowning In Pain
But Storms of Dawn, A new Age
A Dawn Without God

My Spirit Filled With Hate Sets Free
A Force of The Golden Dawn
Without God Entomb Your Fear

I Raise My Fist To The Sky
Swear The Ancient Oath of Black
The Lambs Shall Bleed, Eternally Bleed
God Is Dead and Shall Forever Be

Garden, Still and Cold
Leaves Once Green Turned To Gold
Wrapped In Fields, Eternal Sky
I Bid Farewell, I Die

Birds of The Night, Sing My Songs
Ocean of Tears, Leads So Long
Solitude of My Spirit, I Am Free
Now I Am Dead Forever

Storms of Sadness Cleanse My Wings
I Dwell In Grief After I Die
The Landscapes So Below
I Harken up, The Sunset Choir
Sings From The Palace of Frost
The Place Where I Shall Dwell Now
The Palace For The Lost

Captured Within A Shroud of Autumn
All Is Silent as I Depart The Earth
Only The Sound of A Storm So Far
Drawing Nearer To Catch My Soul

My Life Is Ended, Another Has Begun
Descent Forever To Serve The Dark
Aurora Borelia Shining Bright
Horned Master I Am Thy Spawn
Flutes Of The Past Play Tunes of Sadness
Horned Shape Granted Me Wings
To Fly Towards The Northern Sky
To Reach Silence and Peace
Garden of Ice, Trees of Sorrow
Behind The Gates Is My Tomorrow
Garden of Ice, Trees of Sorrow
My Spirit Is Free To Worlds Beyond

I stand as I cry
Mourning in the Silent rain
Death will light my Burden
Endless is my Sorrow
Gateways so Dark
All these years of Dying

Gone are dreams of Velvet Voices
I am you, we were one
Vast are fields I walk
Where sorrow never dies
The Sky unities with the Blackened Rain
Summon with my Tears
Now descend on WinterWings
My withering Soul.

Let me Die.
Gateways of Bereavement
A Temple of guilt
Falling Deep
Embraced in Grief
My withering soul
Let me Die

Farewell life and all I died for
now my time is over on Earth
Another journey has begun
Alone I died, not praying for mercy
nor praying for Salvation
A lonely Journey in a Darkened Dream
Time has come to spread my Wings

Slow
Descending from a Silent sky
Death comes to take me away
And from the Gateways you hear me
cry

I love you

In Silence Enshrined through Ages
A Dying beauty on a journey far
Fading Roses enchants the Garden
Sleeping, dreaming of my Bride

In Quiescence faces borders the Path
On the Shore of No Hope I am stranded
Fading Roses enchants my Grave
Sleeping, dreaming of my Bride

Lift my Remains from water violent
Unite the body with a Serene Sky
Enlight my wounds with healing Tongue
The Portrait is kissed in a Solemn Night

In Silence Enshrined through Ages
A Rotten beauty on a journey far
Blackened Roses celebrates my Death
How I never could reach my Bride

Putrid Faces engulfs the Path
To the Shore of No Hope, a Bridge
Blackened Roses in the Cradle of Sleep
Whispers: Our Death is Eternal

In Silence I fall through Sorrows
A Dying Lord on Eternal Journey
Your face is torn and lifeless
And the Passage is locked now Forever

Tearful my face borders the Path
Sleeping, dreaming of my Bride
And freezing my soul is praying
Take me the way, through the Night

Ten Strings of Darkness on a Violin Sad
I watch the Mountains where the Frost begins
The Northern Storm is Guiding me
To the Forest

Silently the Nightbirds fly
Their last scream my eternal Dirge
Under the Fullmoon a Funeral
In the Forest

Still I walk with open wounds but the Third is now
rising
Through the ashes of a Dying Love a new soul is born
I watch the feathers like Snow in the Winter
The Angels that fell, splendid to rape

Tall are the shadows that dance before me
as they
Shows the way to the Dawn
An Autumn forest that never reach
Condemned to Sorrow

Chasing the Wind Like a Spirit fly
Through the Autumn trees Towards the Sky
Hoofs are pounding In the clouds above
The Chariot of Sorrow Watch me die
Hear the Violin So sad and blackened
Like a Breeze The songs of Drynhwyl
Chasing the wind Like my spirit die
Dreaming of the Queen The queen of roses

Now they die Pure Sorrow flow
My Souls Funeral Too close to the End
Now they Die Purest blood pours
Forever Die but I must

I must Die
Through the Sky
And the Forest

Follow the Wind, go North my Child
to the purest of Winters
Go to the Forest that never Ends
There you'll find your fate

And to the North I rode, on the coldest of winds
I watched the Mountains where the frost begun
Where no Angels ever dare to tread
Where Death is all mine

At last I found the Throne of Bereavement
Grim and bleak raised to the Sky
The Velvet Thorns of Drynhwyl are mine
and so are death and sadness

See
My final Sacrfice
In the trees you will hear my voice
ever calling ever falling

Ten Strings of Darkness on a Violin Sad
Flowing tunes on Autumn Funeral
Ashes spread in the Northern Storm

Dance away

Open life beneath
Her glory stains the hearse
Procession watch the rain
Mourns the opposite birth
For the wind hopes to die
Far away from home

Same death serves all
Spirits of what will be
Dancing the walls
Scent of silver
through those halls

Shroud of filth embrace me
As the statue stares so cold
Black blue eyes of mourning
Child born to die

Silent tombs wait outside
Monuments of my dreamless rains
Torn by the stars
Heaven calls
Burning with sin
Free from within

Endless spikes of certain death, come closer at my hand
Where they will burn in sin, restless wait
The coffin gaps open, laughing at my fear

Silent tombs wait outside
Monuments of (my) dreamless rains
Torn by the stars
Heaven calls
Burning with sin
Free from within

Dancing through the silent waves
The shimmering moonlight
Over lost angels remains

Whispering through gloomy halls
Beneath the gentle soft caress
Of dreaming shadows

Flowing steams of silver
Through tidal torrents of grief
Time was never there for us
The final tide took the last ones away

Buried visions - of sunrise
Beneath the seas - of torrid soil

Slowly sinking - in the mire
Shades of - emerald fields

Our eyes can't stand the flames
Single sparkles hiding in our palms
They linger before dying away
Fading from out sigh
Loathsome are the ways of those
Who the meadows shall receive
For every glimpse of daylight must vanish
And every soul submit to tide

Through the bleak window of my soul
In marble halls of falling snow
Winter touch the Earth undone
Embittered we embrace the funerals to come

If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I'm catching flies by now
Speaking to someone
Breaking the windows
This house is dead

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Between the memories

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Dead in time

Brave, try the meaning of loss
I know your smile is deadly at this point
Wherever you are I am not

If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world
I guess I should know
The limits of the world
There are moments I find myself
Not breathing at all

Fallen idol
Hanged man
Great winds
Rides the mill
Further into the vast
Limits do not exist

Five day pain
Closer now than ever

Birds escape
Mute flock of winds
One with weather
Sight is getting dim

Grey park look the same
And the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today

Your smile has decayed
It will never be the same
I never thought I would laugh again
I should be knowing this, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today

Now it's dark and you're colder
Now it's dark and I'm older
Now it's dark and you're colder
And you tell me my parks are grey

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today

Grey park look the same
All the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today

We saw it all pass by and you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want
And I really want everything

When I pray
When I believe

I saw it end long before it ended
Life itself turned pale and ended
I saw you cry out acres of your image
Life itself does not heal me

Like a slow scenery I'm losing all my faith
In lifeless motion you're walking like you're dead
Like a slow scenery I'm losing all my faith
In lifeless motion you're walking like you're dead

We saw it all pass by and you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want
And I really want everything

Black theatre of love
Violet dances cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

12 shapes bow before her
I am still one of them
12 morbid ways to die
Her beauty scares me

I'm falling deeper
No more pain to feel now
Touch the silence
Afraid of hell

Black theatre of love
Violet dances drink my blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

I cannot breathe
I am losing life
The moon paints the skyline blue
She died so beautiful

Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep

They lost the Earth in fire
Waved it into a sea
This is not what you saw
The Earth in fire

Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep

atmosphere decays in me i fail to convict my useless days
the lack of substance circle of downfall
exitless ways into pale wake tired attempts to crush the design
it's like nowhere i cannot sell the plight that is mine
everything is real but i'm not here i've lost my strength somewhere
nowhere used to care about weather used to plan the days that came
used to try and watch you used to know my name
someone said remember but i can't remember anything at all
anything at all

all my presence died today i breathe to memories
guess i'm closing down torn and tired of my heart's sound
what's worth to me when life's not around
i will sleep tonight to sleep tomorrow if i sleep at last
a promise has been broken the essence of
love in rust one in a million i'm the one turning pale
any colours to express apart from bleak is hard
and where you are my thoughts are in guilt so forget me forget me not
time to catch something since my ticket says the end
all my flowers withered today the room is quiet guess it's
growing cold dead calm without my heart's sound what's worth
to you when i'm not around i will sleep tonight
to sleep tomorrow
if i sleep at last

all noise that breaks my head i run along the water
you didn't really notice i've left and gone away
you're like waiting uncurable disease left me waiting
inside the fall all waves that traps my breath
i should be in your sight but you didn't really notice
that i've left and gone away

Sounds of imbalance
Sleeps through the never
The artificial lightsource
Is creeping with flies

And this time i break
I will never make
Another day
Defiant to what's delivered

I will find a way
To sever myself
Exit all today
You can't see this
Did you ever say
I break sever
I will find a way
Visit me when i'm there

The weakness of hope
Is the strength of decline
Remember what's past ways
And what i've become
The joy of not being
Something i need
I'm only weather
But only to me

What am i supposed to be
In my life
In your life
In our life
In this life

In shut the door and close my sight
At the end of the day

It's not the way that it used to be
There's no way i'll see
The beginning of things to come
Trapped in the ways of the weak

Somehow better without this
Headlights fuck the city
Somewhere i'm broken
No sensations nevermore

What do you say when you speak
I sense no time
Discouraged television sleep
Not awake until it's dark

Somehow i never leave
This deadhouse
Somehow i don't mind being gone
And if you think you've seen me
I have to prove you
That you're wrong

It's hard to say where i've been
Or am, sleeping in the dark
I don't know where i live
Dirty splintered palace walls

I'm returning from something
To something
I'm returning from something
To something
Guess i'm alright

I can't do what you do
I'm just able to tear it down yeah
Stay in a cold minute of sleep
See the world
Right through the ether

Twisting names inside of me
Electric atmosphere to be
Must carry on one last time
Cannot end what has begun

In your eyes
You're alive
But in my eyes
You're a lie

You can't do what i do
I'm just able to ruin you yeah
Stay in the cold ways of winter
See myself right through the ether

In my eyes
You're the lie

A dead start in my head
And the day's been laid
The things i really want
Always torn from my heart
You never saw the way
How i wanted you to stay
And now you're gone
I'm on my own

When i was thinking this
Was something permanent
You were already thinking
Of going away

And here the air that I breathe isn't dead
Enter life of what's still here
Close the door away from near
Shrouded in autumn's graven ascension
Thought the bridge was over now
Lost the track astray somehow
Who's painting my life in sorrow blue

A relief for a dislocated mind
Shelter for thoughts
Asylum for my soul
This place is the only I need to know

And here the air that I breathe isn't dead
Enter life of what's still here
Close the door away from near
Shrouded in autumn's graven ascension
Thought the bridge was over now
Lost the track astray somehow
Who's painting my life in sorrow blue

Salvation for a lonely sinking kind
All my duties be done
A few years of take
Never leaving again you're forever

And here the air that I breathe isn't dead
Enter life of what's still here
Close the door away from near
Shrouded in autumn's graven ascension
Thought the bridge was over now
Lost the track astray somehow
Who's painting my life in sorrow blue

High white ways
Shattered by rain
Pale dead walls
Nerves pushed in pain
Red light faced
Mirrors of the dead
People in the archways
Eyes full of lead

Always closing down myself
Lower sights and never see
Worlds of noise and worlds of light
Expecting not to be
Not close enough for you
To hear a breath or steal a sigh
But just close enough for me
To take a step and pass you by

As through your shattered eyes
It all came together
And your heart cries
Weeping through the weather
Another way to change your mind
I'm weaker than they say
To leave this all behind
The only way to stay

Don't you know
I'm the end of what we'll be
And right below us
The last thing you'll see

In the water
I saw you drown
Down the water
Saw you drown

As through my shattered sight
You're no longer here
And my heart cries
Sleeping through the light
Another way to change my mind
Never is the day
To leave this all behind
The only way to stay

Running my way towards oblivion
Inside my head electric insomnia
In your mind i'm fed with distrust
Heading for anything better than this

I want to be forgotten
I want you to forgive
How i'm losing all this
It's just the way i live

Running my way towards oblivion
Inside my head smokescreen's gone
Leaving all this to be undone
Heading for anything better than this

Running my way towards oblivion
Outside my head only the dark
In your mind i'm the end of it all
Heading for anything better than this

well I'm here
and summer is gone I hear
so pray for me
as I now leave your town
when did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
moment in my life

you would never sleep at night
if you knew what I've been through
and this thought is all I have
to trust upon when light is gone

my problem was
that you kept me here too long
and today is when
we'll regret that I came by
when did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
moment in my life

life is full of darkness
and murderers come my way
someday you will join them
and I will let you in

tonight I'm nothing
it doesn't matter where I've been
delay of reaction is
the unseen movie of this life

I remember one of my friends
telling me to go ahead

water on every side
there's a dead spot in my eye
if I listen close at night
there's something coming my way

like someone called my name
but I didn't care to look that way
I just fixed my eyes into the crowd
it would have been strange to turn around

if you would tell me that I was someone
then for a second I would think
just like I would try to consider
how it would feel to know

I have to get on with this
it's a decision for tonight
out to look for chances
it is murder of my mind

once I was someone new
I was chosen for a while
then with time I am changing
at least that is what they say

what is worth with being here
I pray so often for a change

you came back to a place without sun
and you don? t seem to know what you've done
to me
now I see
darkness is what you left in me

you went with nothing to fear
came back with nothing to lose
and with summer leaving us here now
we? re thinking of what to chose

I know so well what is wrong
a language that is hard to speak
for all of us lies in death a song
in times when truth is turning weak

so you were with us until the last minute
and then you were gone from here
and I watched and I just figured out
that I will never see you again

I had a choice
you had to leave
into the night
this was my choice

it's so hard to explain what I meant
when I said that I wanted you dead
but I saw you fuck up and I just can't get back
the feeling I had for you

so I put all my strength into my only will
it was the only thing to do
and now I only regret that I cried
cause you would never do that for me

will I be strong
no friends by my side
in a black room
no spirits abide

who is judge now
when I wait for this
punishment

when I come in
from where I've been
they raise their voices
on a given signal

by a black road
giving a brief smile
something's on the way
forgotten for a while
and you try to speak this
without a voice down by a black road
we try to forget and try to make it through

someday we'll go
further from this right into the bliss
some night we'll try
to leave this place for another

they keep pushing me
so far from every chance
makes it so much harder
for me to carry on
so I try to speak this
without a thought down by a black road
we try to forget and try to make it through

this is no good way out
but it's a challenge or so I see it
death's head upon my wall
afield lies nothing but disorder

no good can come of this
whatsoever I can tell you
no good will ever come of this
the road to happiness I never knew

I read a letter I never sent
and saw me smiling on a picture
this is nothing I remember
whatever made me feel so

there are children
on the freeway
I have my ways
playing with death

end
sometimes a start for others
end
I don't know the word beginning

sometimes fear is power
like when I lost control
this time it has to come to an end

I'd like to try to live my life again
I'd like to see where I was going wrong

so near
so close
something bad is seen
but I
seem to be
the only one that can see
there is a darkness coming

and they
the others
they don't know a thing of what's next
but I'm not here to say
what should be done about this
I just lift my eyes to watch

I saw it coming
something bad

I sense infliction in the air
it's only me
I'm fucking up old times
it's a remembrance

o this
black session in my mind
o the black

I was too weak to fight
once more I let go
it is a black session
an invitation of sorts

I keep on living in this my only wish
that life will be good someday
I keep on losing my sleep because of this
seems so hard just to stay

so if you come by just this last time
I'll be here
and I will talk to you like
if this had never been

o this
black session in my mind
o the black

i've turned down all devotion
i'm so far from being here
can't bring forth more power
than i have already done

tonight i'm trying
and i see all dread in me

but then i lose again
all hope of being someone
this lack of devotion
will put me to an end

so if you want to save me
and stop me when i run
just tell me that i'll have now
a day less to live when i'm done

knew i would fall if i tried
so i held back for a while
you pushed me so hard, i had to go
i tried to be strong, then i failed

i would like to say this
just in case you didn't know

well your soul is fractured
i know what it's like as well
i have sold my soul
i traded it for hollow gold

it is to see a traitor go free
it is to feel a filter in me
it is to leave the lights that I saw
it is to ask: is it easy to go

in this dead hour
here with you
seconds are worthless
in this dead hour
when all is blank
minutes are worthless

how long will it take until
there will be room again for hope
it is so sad to see
dispossession
it has become my obsession

it is to have a knife in my back
it is to say my soul got a crack


the walls are painted
different every second
my eyes are of chrome
it is television

can't let go of my leg
it's itching so and bleeding
layer by layer
I'm peeling away

burn down my house
and make something happen
stab me in the heart

and make something stop
'cause I am so distracted
I am slightly shocked
by how things can keep going
like a dead man's clock

a mirror is hanging
kinda loose on my wall
I'm passing it sideways
I'm saying hello

my brother is halfways
through a book I've left him
called me today
to see what I'd say

we had you down on your knees
we were kicking you in the head
we tried to hang you from the trees
we didn't stop until you were dead

we must bury you
we must bury you
we must bury you so deep
that noone should find you

forgive me for covering my eyes
forgive me for not saving you
forgive me for being so unwise
forgive me for letting this
be true

why have you put so many things into my eyes
that I can't see clear
who's paid you for telling me what I'm worth
and run in fear
it has been for me a strain to see already
what have you done
the rising noise
the sharpened smells
the deadened sight

what is it in my eyes
a piece of broken glass
is this the time I should be on my knees for you
is this your way of telling
another has been found
now I know,
it's teargas in my eyes

I can't say that I am free
as long as they return
if I had a way out of here
would I then return?
they seldom will speak, no
they only breathe, slow

do they know that I'm afraid, so afraid
they depend on my worries, so I know
and I'm awake, I'm right in the circle now
I am with them

there is no way I am going to be free
because their hearts, they are similar to mine
there is no way they are going to release me
from this chain of rows unto our own hearts

I can't say that I regret my promises
I can't say that I regret,
behaving like my enemies
I seldom will speak, no
I only breathe, ghost

who could call my name without regretting
who could see beyond this my darkness
and for once save their own prayers
who could mirror down just a little
of their sun

how could this go so very wrong
that I must depend on darkness
would anyone follow me further down
how could this go so very far
that I need someone to say
what is wrong
not with the world but me

who could call my name without regretting
who could promise to never destroy me
tonight my head is full of wishes
and everything I drink is full of her

all the white lights falling

the blue lights are falling
night is warm
came down with a promise
I have my best shirt on
I lower myself now
it is a way to forget
of last year's failure

WILL THE STREETLIGHTS REFLECT ME WELL ENOUGH
AM I TRANSPARENT WHEN I AM CLEAN
WILL THE DARKNESS AROUND ME BE SO STRONG
THAT THERE IS NO WAY I CAN BE SEEN

boys will we become
heroes of this night
or am I just happy
whenever not sober
I cleaned myself well
clean today

and when I pause for a breath
I see millions like me

my prospects have become less promising
i find it hard to believe in anything
seems I lost my world and so I lost my faith
and I can't go back to where I've been

a brand new day
it can't get worse
hear myself say
it can't get worse

I have no lies or truth in what I say
there is no meaning
the words are numb and I am so afraid
there is no meaning

this is another chance or so I'm told
by those who can push themselves at any cost
they bless me with their fingers crossed
my youth is stolen, transformed and sold

she's got black hair
and she has got a black dress
she's pretending
that her life is a mess
but I cannot rest
with so many worries
I can't lie down
and say I am done

I live 'cause I need more light
I hope I can change today
she would never think of changing
too much fucking emo, it's false I know

she stops me in the street
and asks me to follow

I would if I could
if I wouldn't mind breaking her

o my sweet nurse
pull the curtain aside for a while
so that I can for once have
the sun in my eye
you smile and say
it's a fine day

o my sweet nurse
pull the curtain aside for a while

then like a ghost at night
you come around all dressed in white
talking to me
and so I have to drink
the water with your poison spilled
for no more will

o my sweet nurse
seems you have so little time
that you rather put
me to sleep than sit by my side

I have been destroyed
by the perfection that is life
see I'm moving soon
see my feet are already on the road

and if you know where I'm going
don't tell a soul

I live all for this thing
that I heard someone sing
when you have noone

noone can hurt you

IT WAS SO EASY TO SEE
HOW FUCKING GOOD IT ALL COULD BE

I'm drawing back time
to feel things once again
as when I had found them

I saw you grow older
saw myself grow older too
but not as much as you
if I only knew

I had sulfur in my heart
but not enough strenght to give it a spark
I didn't know when to start
when we were bright or when we were dark
I had a wind in my chest
blew as hard as it ever could
I could have written books for you
if I only knew

I held my head down I know
and you walked around in circles
I'm sure you already knew
if I only knew it too

so much I want to ask you
you have no time to let me do so
there is no light in my pathway
you must tell me where to go

left with spring alone
I withdraw from this
I lived so differently
it wasn't good enough

I was with you alone
winter was gone

things once blurred are twice sharpened
when I think of what I could have
blood has left me even before you
can never return a second time

I lived so differently
did it all for it
but everything is now
a film on rewind

to completely dissolve,
what method is used
i cannot sleep,
my hands are bruised
there's a hole in the wall,
torn up anew
one dead eye,
the colour of you

to vanish for life
and promise to stay
away from the knowing,
bird in a cage
i'd give so much
for the courage to go
if i ask for your help,
then you will know

so help me disappear
or to believe in a change
no way out of here
that i can see
or the nightmares that burn
into my head at night
make them disappear
so i can breathe

looked out the window twice,
just to be sure
that noone was standing
outside the door
but it's just as calm
as it was before
they're all gone now,
not there anymore

isolated myself
for the sake of freedom
i clenched my fist
for the sake of kindness
i read a book full of strange
words
loneliness is a disease

The thin darkness here
Not strong enough to make you appear
I once changed my style
When they said hello I said goodbye
I once played a role
I was out there marketing my soul

The city of glass that I live in
The coldness from my brothers skin

I trusted you you lied
It's all I hear a fucking lie
I don't give a shit it's over now
It's all I know you broke the vow

Truth is I have seen it come
Seen the ghost of the sun
Can't have it undone
In time we all call out for relief
See two lovers meet
Pass you on the street

O my, your fever is high
I lay my hands upon you
O my, haven't you heard
The truth is untrue?

Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
I'm one second after you
Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
Just a second after you

Someone inside your room
Who is it there behind you?
What does he want from you?

Sleeper what did you see?
I close the window to the street
Parents died, left a child
Unattended for a while

Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
I'm one second after you
Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
Just a second after you

Someone inside your room
Who is it there behind you?
What does he want from you?

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing
If you die now how can I then live on?
Don't give up, you must live on

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing

If you die now

The way the light hits the road
The way I am unable to protect you
O I'm running away
I will never forgive myself
For running away from you

He came back to your house
I didn't take it as a promise
Always thought it was a lie
He went too far the fucker
It's not like I owe him money
This is different

So gather your strength and break free
Or you will surely die
Gather your strength don't follow me
'Cause I will surely die

The way my eyes cannot move
The way I hope to be protected
And for one moment I thought
That I was lost among the lights of houses

My dreams of violence
See them coming true

Stand aside now no one will survice can't tell you how I know
In some time I will change my name and lay low
In the light you can see me walk down by the way
The one who did this to us well he got away

Keep it quiet here I will not tolerate your noise
This is where I listen for the forgiving voice

It haunts my dreams

Bypassed the day I can hear them coming
They walk round my door and speak of their coming
My trial awaits got nowhere to run
My only words how soon you have come

And I think about what you told me
When I was about to join in

Defy only if you have a way to resist the lies
Decline only if you have the intention of taking this advice
Apply only if you're not afraid to see your spirit die
Retreat only if you dare not hear yourself say goodbye

Who brought me here this place is familiar
Where houses are black under the sun
Strangers pass on streets with strange names
All I can think is how soon they have come

Look at me now they have cut my hair
It's a long way back
They kicked me down and I could not rise
I will never arrive

Old light and new colours your picture hangs in the night
Is this the right time to set one free and go away
In the emptiness behind you I will walk about
Surely you'll miss me but long live the doubt

What will replace us
What will be our memory of this time
Second hand impressions
Hand them over so we can let it die

I remember one time when we were abroad
I was laughing at a book I had bought
But you were standing against the hotel wall
Frozen in an unknown thought

Cool night gave my truth for a lie
Will you be here when I try
I'm not set cannot do it yet
Will you be here when I try
Our wealth breeds emptiness
Another day to compress

My lips are dry you gave me drugs to try
Hold me when I die
The sky has frozen to a wall
We die we all

One year from now will I be strong
Will I stand up for what I've become

Everything I have I will give you
And everything I own I owe you

One year from now dare I call you mine
A year ahead from now it's a different time

I could not breath against the wall
The clash of light against the floor
They held me up against the wall
Too young to be ignored

Standing by a building
Leaks out information
Passive death of freedom gets me
Where's my security
Behind my back it goes
Early morning's coming
The risk that I am taking
Recall a song that I heard as a child
No more false immunity
Inside the blistering cold

My youth unknown to me
I'm walking by a wire
What's left from me to breathe
Cold smell of fire
One day I will be free
I was born to be no one
My youth unknown to me
I walked behind the sun

Emptiness within me
Exit signs within me
The one you're looking for is not here
Had no security
He will not come back

I have no name my face a blur
I speak only to answer them
White noise becomes a voice
I hear it constantly

I dare not break the circuit
I rest only for a short time
This time I promise I won't give up

I have no right to let it go
I have no right to do so

My vision now is incomplete
I am affected by the warmth
A change of tone unusual sound
Is this the time to decline

They control the circuit
The embodiment of what I've done
If I waver from this circle
A second pass and then I'm found
But he who walks behind me
He once saw the morning sun

I hold my breath and check the time
One minute no collapse
If you only knew what I would do for you
One thirty breathing lapse
We're going in my voice is thin
When I tell you to remember
That no one will find you
My promise from the heart
If we part my pulse will guide you through

Be still for a moment
Everything depends upon you
If you die I will die too
Once we were heroes
But everything has changed since then
Now they recognize you too

I stay too long something's wrong
You walk out of the picture
I hold my breath and check the time
One thirty I collapse
We went in my voice was thin
When I told you to remember

I'm the evidence
You passed the test and that's so good for you
O love will you read the letters I will send to you
Will I come along
Will they let me out to take the test
O love is the score enough for me to pass the test

Come by you have come far
All I had I lost in the flood
Come sit with me at the bar
Tell me of progress strengthen my blood
No one here knows my name
I have traded my memories for things
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Why have you waited so long

Come by you have come far
Long since I saw you so how have you been
Come sit with me at the bar
How long since they told you that they had found him
No one here knows my name
I gave up my worries for one good thing
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Was it because I never told you
I was going away
That you waited so long
Was it because your fucking dreams
Meant nothing to me
That you waited so long

It runs from the top of my fingers
Into my hands
What is it I have been drinking
I do not understand
I thought I'd lost you my brother
I'm so glad you came
My regards to the ones that I love I miss them
Tell them I love them I miss them

under lights that never go out
we drive
and focus on the change
you become my face as I replace it
with the mirrors and the glass
and the houses that we pass

we drive all night
you've come a long way to find
emptiness
we hear it all night
see it flicker overhead
so void of life

in due time all of this will pass
in a sudden storm
when you take my hand
so cold this april
don't you think
we call on the void
the void will answer us

Money growing on a tree
The cold you have come to find
Money going through the wire
The cold you have come to find

You once were the one who had it
The code against the code

Wait
So much to discover
Wait across the borderline

Soul thinned out
All the filth that soiled your baby
Spit it out when they're coming for you
Lowered's heir

Do you have water in your car
I might get thirsty along the way
Are you sure it isn't very far
Are we getting there today
And is it hard
And complicated
You displace me
Drive me there
Let me sleep
We are coming to an end here see
Drive me there
I'm meant to be deceived
We are coming to an end here see
Reaching for a sentence in my mouth
Well hidden under my tongue
I know what things are all about
I made it so easy for you when you came
For your safety

And here you are
So much time did you waste from times before
So shut down your sky
Bow down, lights out & die
And now you go
The cold chill cracks, a positive self-detach
Inanimate heart
Hurrying, racing forward
A destined goodbye
Bells rang out the day of your worst fear
Obscure graduation day
Left you but with memories to bear
Lost in hopelessness
Seclusion cut you just as deep as knives
Dissolving the bonds
Time was set to fade away your lives
You said you would always give you love
You said you would always be caring
You said you would never abandon
You said you would

Leaders come
Stand in line
Reveal your true self & conform
I sold my song
Crossed the borderline
I found something I'd never adjust to

Come here
I've Paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here
I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you
Do you

Carbon soul
Transparent & played out
See you soon in non-fiction
I sold my song
My mouth was sewn
but it's coming undone that's why I sold out

Visions come
Visions come
In a sickroom bed
There's something left to learn
Pass them on
Let it show
Let the rich meet death
Confront our own concern

See us sleep behind the glass
Unaware of crime
Will you wake us up before it is time

The red circle holds the only light
Break down my perspective
And notify everyone when the time is right
My mouth remains inactive

So when you let me in
You let me justify my own reward
You put your hands on me
And I learn the words I didn't know before

I am ice
I am clear
Let the world be cold
Our deliberation
Pass them on
Let it show
Let the words come slow
Your constant incantation

Repeating cycle of light/no light
There's nothing in the airspace
There's no one in the airspace
Repeating cycle of love/no love

False
The dream is so far
Come and take the consequence
Few things are as certain
Winter state
Oppressive wait

Evacuate
Assemble here
Soil's song
In your throat
Future death
In your reach
Who's first
Ok

Mask
Your face well hidden
Keep your last words in your hand
Fold it and open up
Time to go
Release the glow

The neck and then the chain
The head is hung in shame
I thought that you had grown
That you would carry on
But now that I have gone
What else has been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing
Are you strong when you're with him
The one who's placed you above us all

I think of love
I let it pass
It feels like fire
But it won't last

What is it coming to
I'm unwilling to go on
You have lost
No one has won

Wave back at me
Back is turned
If I fail once
Circuit burn

Saw you in the lampglow
You fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden
I will be

Consternation
Internal source
overthrowing
Stray from course

Hurts to see
My incapacity
Shame
Idle mind
No
You have changed me

My mouth is shut
Stupidity have shut my mouth

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard my knuckles turn white
When you clear the streets
And kill the lights

See the line
Border to freedom
The words
Underlined
My name
You have changed it

Your tone change to cool
This is how you tell me once again
How I have nothing on you
How everything is supposed to end

Father
I won't make it
It's the journey of a life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done

A rush through the rusted veins
Illuminate the face of one
So i have a light
So unaware about the consequence

I heard no warning
About the little compromise
The distorted views you had

Cold white spring
A wordless song I sing
Eye
White cloud
All my thoughts are in doubt


Vapor
As thin as it gets
I stare right through
The severe sickness in this room
Not mine
It comes from you

Soul cold
Indeed
There won't be a time when I'm at ease
Increase coldness
Increase ignorance

Please
Rewind and look at you
As on film
You will see a mask of shame
I think you will
Perceive
Your position in life
So unworthy

Find and twist the answer
Save no one from harm
As seen in the vision
Sick sleep sick dead earth

You come clean
Waves collide now
Defenseless numb arms
And no voice of reason

So how come you invited me too
You knew I wanted you
You glide above
So this night belongs to you
I know this isn't through
Are you dead to love

I see the bright lights
It's the month of July
It's violent here
Why have you left me
If only you could stay
And keep me in
It's violent here
Why did you run from me

Heat
Night devour me
Repeat
Repetition

Are you in or are you out
The words are stones in my mouth
Hush little baby don't you cry
Truth comes down
Strikes me in the eye

Turning season within
Brand new nails across my skin
But who am I to imply
That I was found
That I found you in the white

To overcome this
I become one with
The quiet cold of late November
If you don't see
I'll remain unseen
Until there's time to be remembered

So I had a green light
I was lost in city lights
Not so far from a try
This is not our last goodbye

So I found you
Found a way all through
The quiet cold of inner darkness
And now that you're here
It becomes so clear
I have waited for you always

Movement
Subdued back then
So quiet now
Subsequent
Systematic violence
The great cold distance

The itch
The urge

Make way
Think of something
Thin out the fear
Past the tracks
Part the Ways
One stand here
Medicate
Kill the itch
Check the air
And push to get there

Monochrome
Symbol on the surface
Reduced Illumination
Chemical Inheritance

The lies
The Fever

Pushing the will
Being alive
Well I have been
I came far
The process of trying
To act unharmed
It will fade out

Thoughts will unwind
No longer mine
They are for you
When you come
So long
I'm cutting here
And the water's blood
When you come

The sky moves faster at this time of year

At city centre 9 pm
Just like you wrote
And i try to think about
Snow coming in
Just like before
I will be on stand-by

Releasing the vapour
Into the lung
Letting the wings unfurl
And for a moment i feel young
I call on the bird
Unfurl

It’s time to chose side now
That’s what you said
When we talked on the phone
So white our eyes
You are still
Are you paralyzed

Rage from a distant
The name unfamiliar
Spikes reach the heart
Time set for rewind

The dark will rise
Abandon your freedom
Give up the right to find the true self
Forsake your own reasons

Forsaker

Hand of a leader
Bleached by snowfall
Opposition is drugged
The great end is sweeping in

In the nights of old I always wished
In the longest year that had me down
And I would freeze if you ever asked me
That was my way

Confront the guilt and try to overcome
Do not go away
I'm not there yet

I can see fire
When I fall behind (fall behind)
When I give up
My thoughts redefined
How cold is the flame
Of our uncompromising future
How cold is the sun

The city lights fading still
The coming sky so white
And I'm the dark of this our new day
This is my way

Find the one
This weight will hold me down
How cold is the sun

You there
Bringer of my despair
You are stagnation of hope and will
O you personify loss and remorse
And you hide until my fears reappear

The love for life once bright
Out of sight
A burning fuse
The only flame I have
Fate's spiral down this curve
(Shall only serve)
The seeds growing my misery
These wounds kill time
My struggle sublime
Idle the blood
A black state of mind
All dreams left behind

You claim to be my long absent friend
You are the cancer that just moved in
You come with the dark night of the soul
But I am turning my back on you
You know I do

Idle the blood
A black state of mind
All my dreams left behind

In the still eclipse
Every light is a heartbeat
In the spring
Where I watch
The sudden change

I find this so hard

Onward into the battle
Time is growing so dark around me
I, shallow one
I burn us out
Day by idle day

Days at the sea
My words are incomplete
In the blind spot
Where I saw you
On the 4th at night

I find this so hard

Sold are the eyes I have
And cold is the wait for nothing
And dark
I write my name in a long line
How is it possible for you to try

It's coming true
I've changed my name but I will pass it on to you

Journey
No present thoughts
Coming day
Darkest wave

It's coming true
I've changed my name but I will pass it on to you
Our thoughts entwined
You speak
And I hear other words behind

I wave from the edge of the pier
And fade into dreams of sleepers
Marked
I have had this stain for a long time
We called on the bird long before

Evening
Coming through the crowd
I hold my head high
Straining
Out here dissonance surrounds
I hold my head high
I see the wings behind your back

Burned all the maps to reach you
Watching distant names
I saw danger
And then I felt the pressure

Downfall
This is our time
The setting sun over all I ever had

So when did you come to think
That you would tell me that I have no one
And when do you think that you
Will give back the things that you owe me

Burned all the maps to reach you
Watching distant names
I saw danger
And then I felt the pressure

Loving mother
He has come
To take your son

Listen
How he strides the earth
When only animals are awake
When the shattering of ideals begin
God of ruin
Will come to you

Fallen
From the faded sky
Nephilim comes through foul air
And when morals will decline
God of ruin
Will come to you

The pledge
I've forgotten this time
I am so uncertain
That my heart will go on
My beloved one
If you were here you'd find
That I'm not feeling well
But that will have to go on

And though summer unwinds now
I have no reason to follow
I have only you
My sun is pale
My heart's old

Why
So quiet this new night
There's a white cloud
Under my eyelid
My beloved one
There is swirling dark
Shrouding my freedom

Cold is the undertone
Hold my hand
I'm in the waiting line
Mute I stand
Barren ground

Our inconvenient burden
It could be lifted off of us
If we gave up
To finally let go
Of the free will that we were given
Our graves
Above the timberline
Our name chalked
The pressure of wealth
No longer found

The unforgiving void
The forge in which our values burn
The resting leech
Our thinning minds
In my abstinence I turn to nothing

Our graves
Above the timberline
Our name chalked
The pressure of wealth
No longer found

Let them inherit this fire now
Lest they will forget that we were
Ever here

I will rise
To dreams of freedom
And avow
To return the treason that came under your reign
The day and then the shade
I have slept
Inside the season that froze within my grasp

All my fears come into view
There must be an end soon
And every waking hour
Is part of the lie

I will rise
Over glass cathedrals
And let go
With my eyes resting upon the nearing dark
The day and then the shade
I have slept
Within the reason that kept me so remote

Make a brand new vow
In the heat of an evening
The darkness swarms
I was nothing, ever
But red like the sun
Dying down over the freeway
Is the brand new sky
Over the mountain ridge

Make a brand new vow
In the heat of an evening
The darkness swarms
I was nothing, ever
But red like the sun
Dying down over the freeway
Is the brand new sky
Over the mountain ridge

Won't forgive your ways
I strip my mind with all but scorn
The scales of madness mesmerize

Voice your dead prayer

Hey
You used me
But I had none to confide

Under a veil of stars
Where the darkness grows
The pressure from the chain that you hold me in
Ornament of scars
And the darkness rising
Over the ashen stains that I hold within

Did not forget the name
I stripped my mind with all but you
The scales of madness just before we die

The blinding white
So far behind I am
And running
Over idle ground
This evening
I kept my word
Did you
I'm turning around
Wait for your sound

Only so far
According to who
Departer
The journey of our lives
I'm (when) so slow did
Compared to you you first stay
Departer I swear it's the truth
It's the month of July

Brother
In your eyes I was the stronger
So how am I to cover you now
Without shadowing your path
This time
I watch from the sidelines
Your ghost in the limelight
Face your fears
And pierce the night

So close
If only you knew
Defender
The story of our lives
I'm so why rash would I swear
Compared to you
Surrender You know it's the truth
It's the path of our lives

When my heart stops
Will my wings unfold
Did you know that I had no one but you

When my eyes close
Will your blood turn older
Did you know that I had no one but you

In the snow veil
Where the ring of promise fell
In the cool white air
One stood abiding
When the road turns
Will my ghost find freedom
Did you know that I have nothing
So I

Sold my love
Forgot the vow
It feels like nothing comes to mind
I pull the weight
And sing
That there's a new cloud over my grave
Now I know
That it did kill me when I could not have you
Sold my heart

In the weak light
I saw you becoming the lie
Taking it all for granted
Like freedom
It's something you'll never have

Forget what's said
And hear me sing to you
How I've set out to kill my soul
The nightward ways
The labour it brings
The verdict that I came for
Migration's song

Patterns of death overwhelms
Fixation rise
I came along the way
And came to a conclusion
The indifferent sky
Is made of lead and so beautiful
Submission
Come to will

The parting
End origin
Fade into earth

Times ablaze
Under the flags we chose
Denied my step and froze my heart
Yet I stare
With nothing left to do
The verdict that I came for
Migration's song

Take your well deserved step
Into darkness
I'll become your eyes
You have no other
We have to walk along this wire
Trust the one that never trusted you

This breaking vow rests so near my tongue
Anchor on the cloud
Shade upon the sun
You took my word for it
The vanishing of doubt will unfold my empty space
Your time froze over

I must lead the way for this conclusion
I let you inherit these words I sing to you
See how death will bestow seclusion
The one you are looking for is hidden from view

In my absence now
When time will pass
In nothingness abide
See the evening rise
And take my word for it
Focuses beyond your vision

I must lead the way to this conclusion
I let you in hell with these words I say to you
See how death will bestow seclusion
The one you are looking for is hidden from you

Do you remember when it didn't used to be so dark
And everything was possible still

You will never rest
Until the stars burn out
My day is done
I love the sound of no one coming by
Tomb beneath the trees
The name unsung
The darkness in the cracks

I am not what you have waited for

Trust
Nothing is enough
This hunting ground
I need the freedom to control my own
I need the sound of rain
Wearing dependence down
The line must be kept so thin
To live near life
Not within

No need to take the test
Before the dark must shine
Reflect my eyes
And strip this creation of mine
Tomorrow is so long
The dead end king is here
Black wings upon his back

White sun
Spring of wealth
Come for a good time
It's not what I have
Vibrate
Life on the line
My racing heart
Your vacant mind

If I sow a wind now
I will reap a storm
You saw me sliding away from the sun
And tomorrow
Who will come
And put their hand over mine
Mine with the burning shape of a gun

Washed out
Soul of money
Couldn't keep the fire
It's not what I do
Vibrate
Life on the line
My racing heart
It's all I find

Inside the sickness
Rest
Inside the sickness
Rest

If I sow a wind now
I will reap a storm
You saw me sliding away from the sun
And tomorrow
Who will come
And put their hand over mine
Mine with the burning shape of a gun

Think
Of the days when I had too much
Of the things we found
Resistance died down
Fell on the frozen soil

Bleed a little for a different day
Going deeper to come away

On the concrete sky
I saw the buildings rise
But keep our lights in the shadow still
In the wind's eye
Where our reflection dies
Glass shrines of muted will

Dead
Is the time that I see from here on out
This burial ground
One more down
And buildings recoil

So solitary
You have been
Your time starts to fade
Distorted sky
And you find me
Revolve inside
My blood is yours too
That's what you say
It couldn't be further from the truth

I find
The soul in medication
All my loving has turned and washed away

You took my mind's eye
You bring it wherever you go
How could you take away
The burning I had
My rage
Static
The closing line
Whatever you say
It's my heart you leech
You crushed the edge of symmetry

Insignificant
You are still
But my words in your mouth
Lingering
Spilling over

I see
You don't want liberation
You keep belonging to what's not even here

Hear my thin voice
Hear my words fall down
See my ambitions fade out
Had so much better times

At night walking on the tracks
Change my perspective
Idle hands with wounds and cracks
Stale
Ineffective
But past the veil
The memories of things
Still so in love with you

So dense this strife
Kicked the life
I feel this weight upon my heart

Indecision
Sow the seed
Aspiration is never within reach
At night there is no other view
Sing a song for the ones who never made it

In the ward under yellow lights
Under linden trees I am transparent
And led to believe that things would change if I go away
The lowering sky under which we go

So dense this strife
Kicked the life
I feel this weight upon my heart

Hear my thin voice
Hear my words fall down
See my ambitions fade out
Had so much better times

Constant noise behind the overcoming
I had no choice but to rearrange
The scar is open
I am not allowed to understand
I take it as you're not coming back

Indecision
Sow the seed
Aspiration is never within reach
At night there is no other view
Sing a song for the ones who never made it

See my ambitions fade out
Had so much better times

As life's four-way stop
The tinge in your shadow drops
Fate pulls you down for the count
With broken promises to amount

Time seal our ways
Through heart of our hiding place
When all our lifelines have been crossed
Some scars can never heal from what we lost

To fail the test and depart the strong
Is to light the way where you have gone
For only our funerals to come
A requiem in death, a song

And it seems to be
That consistency is not what lingers ahead
But a virtue of the dead
One of these days
Hours pass and night stays
When your spirit won't turn anew
The world shuts down with no goodbye to undo you

Breathing lifeless
We are not afraid to die
Breathing lifeless
You're afraid not to live

Breathing lifeless
We are not afraid to die
Breathing lifeless
You're afraid not to live

To fail the test and depart the strong
Is to light the way where you have gone
For only our funerals to come
A requiem in death, a song

How long
Is the pattern going to speak for you
How far can your voice reach
Your song below the night
From my view
I can see you
Shudder where you are standing
In the vision
Cyan blue

Now
October
This time you won't be needing me

To run along the freeway
To weigh one's heart against the oncoming dark
You left me with the pills
We had plans but you couldn't make it
Through the trees
What took you so long
The high grass
What took you so long

Translate the fire
The venom's rush inside your heart
How long can winter
Colour your every word
And the skyline
Past the houses and the cities
Hyperopia
Carmine red

Now
This river
This time I will

In the prayer
Can't seem to find the right words
But we stretch our dead arms
For salvation
The foundation
And the chemical need
Discordance put a veil
Over my creed

So sweet my fever now
Embraced by its tainted wings
Cup my hands and taste the spite
Immune to the truths you told

In the wake
Reverence in my every move
The wretched stars aligned
For dead wisdom
The apparition
Rise with my every breath
Grasping for the one
Who lie beneath

You leave now
Leave my void of prayers
Take these words to go with you
Take the splinters
See them fall

Idle stare
Who will come forth from the dry wind
And find my blood
And clothes and rust
Cleaned the past
Like water through stone
Earth did cast a shade
Over my sleep

Dim my lights
Time is frail
You shut my mind
But oh well
Trapped and choked
Erased my trail
Split the chest
My heart couldn't feel more pale
Only once
Could I see clear

Vexation
Internal void
My dreams are getting darker and darker
And darker

This life before me
Its blood runs so still
The call of the bird
The song that makes the hours go

The change
Inactive
Dead letters
Form these words

Dim my lights
One by one
The sordid pale
Broken run
Confined in escape
On burnt grass
Below the crest
Lie in wait for the ending

Songs that make the hours go

Sun has lost
Mountains fell
What took away our anchor
Snow in the old sky
Escape is a long dead end

We need to rise higher

Temples burn
Fires underneath
What controls our anger
Moon coming in
Sun has lost
Did you know
Mountains fell

Letting one second go on
To go over a lifetime
We were such good friends
Will you find me where I am now

So dark
Once an amusement park
Troubled whispers sound
On a mute merry-go-round

So cold
Once a playground of gold
Caved in long ago
And then poisoned with the snow

Oceans of time
Broken patterns align
Hearts washed upon the isle

It carries your name
Like radiance in the rain
The wailing sirens alarm

Old memories hang on and gravitate by weights of sorrow
Through cracks and wounds our pain reflected in a thousand mirrors
It is time for deeds to take the shape of vows and codes of promise
The time to let our minds speak silently in the act of darkening

Out of reach and gone from view
Now light is one step behind you
On the other side of the soul
The void resolves one final role

Collapse into absence

You wait by the river.
Days are long and melt right into nothing.
You wait for my eyes.
And who else is waiting for the summer sky?

Your still voice drives me further under now.
No tomb or blessing, buried in the poisoned ground.

Unbearable to have the beast untied.
The coming of my ruin, age tears the spine.
The devil inside comes back to escort me.

I burn, this fever drives me straight into your arms again.
Unspeakable, drop your withered pride, come back and forgive me.

Freezing in the blue light,
I hid my plan under a blanket of dust.
The pressure of the years,
delivers me back into your grip.

I am pledging my love to you, still waiting.

Breathing under siege,
oppressed by the dreams I have to feed.
Crushed by the flood, I won't let you go.

Born unwise,
seeking trust in a broken creed.
Crushed by the grey, I'm waiting for colour.

You wait by the river, you wait for my eyes.
And who else is waiting for the summer sky?

Your still voice drives me further under now.
No tomb or blessing, buried in the poisoned ground.

Unbearable to have the beast untied.
The coming of my ruin, age tears the spine.
The devil inside comes back to escort me.

I burn, this fever drives me.
Come back and forgive me!

I burn, this fever drives me straight into your arms again.

Breathing under siege,
oppressed by the dreams I have to feed.
Crushed by the flood, I won't let you go.

Born unwise,
seeking trust in a broken creed.
Crushed by the grey, I'm waiting for colour.

In the morning
The battle for endurance has been lost
Sold my worth and dignity the same
I am shade
And essence of corroding time

So pale next to my love
In every way
Meaningless scar
Through the evening
Where our wisdom turns to rust
Fill the gap with lost integrity
I become the one you haven't seen for years

Liberating rain
Two shots and I need more
Adapt to the flow
A taste of the void
Get back and focus again
More of the fire

It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old

In every way
Meaningless scar

I become the one you haven't seen for years

Liberating rain
Two shots and I need more
Adapt to the flow
A taste of the void
Get back and focus again
More of the fire
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old

The weighted clouds coming by
Has me looking
Right here under the sky
And I left my home
Passed the evening fires
In the blink of an eye
I had closed the door behind me

The vapour of old love
Will transfigure through a veil of clarity
I sense my grave way below the mire

Sorrow will find you
Its voice has given way to mine
Heart pumps death into our heredity
Who wants to come with me?

For every dream that is left behind me
I take a bow
With every war that will rage inside me
I hear the sound
Of another day in this vanishing life
Returned to dust
And every chance I've pushed away
Into the night

Time won't let go
It's got you in debt now
And it's got me crawling all the way back to the start
I swear that I saw you there
Your hands were reaching out for mine

Sorrow will find you

For every dream that is left behind me
I take a bow
With every war that will rage inside me
I hear the sound
Of another day in this vanishing life
Returned to dust
And every chance I've pushed away
Into the night

I sense my grave way below the mire

Leaving the choirs behind to sing
of anything fair, of lilac spring
A dream of truce behind my eyes
A life of journeys will unwind

Emerge through idle air

Born under a troubled sign
Will it hurt to see me find
the long lost peace of mind

Darling, you had me here for a while
It breaks my heart to see you cry
In the wake of incomplete time

Darkness overthrows!

Map of nowhere is in my hand
The roads are blurred, sojourners land
So take however long you want, but don't forget my love
You've pledged yourself to come along

You're lost in reveries, holding back the tears
Faint sound of the wires
The butterfly is in the fire now

Lost in a memory you're holding my hands
One heart is in the ground
The other is veiled in silver all around

Born under a troubled sign
Will it hurt to see me find
the long lost peace of mind

Darling, you had me here for a while
It breaks my heart to see you cry
In the wake of incomplete time

Bring on salvation
I have a way to find mine: I swallow light
And what if I move, lapsing into failure
In the lowering night, in the lowering night

I had waited for you
though I was certain you wouldn't come back no

Into the after hours

Smudged my heart for all to see
But it's so quiet now, makes it harder to shine
Had a dream about tomorrow
But with nothing more to think about, I fade out

Bring on sedation
I have waited a long time and dragged myself a long way
There's a flight to Medellín, twelve hours of drinking gin
Awakened by summer

Sever the ties that were once unyielding
Packed my money under night's neon curtain

Smudged my heart for all to see
But it's so quiet now, makes it harder to shine
Had a dream about tomorrow
But with nothing more to think about, I fade out

Rid my mind of residual thoughts
until knowledge will arrive
They closed my eyes
and cold stars would align

In the city the lights are many
but I can't find it amusing anymore
I watch the night unfold and vanish
stood on the highway

So hey
let's celebrate there's no need to cry
No one can comfort you there's no one around

But baby
Can you hear the sky blowing at night
It's our wealth

And I'm ready to go if you're already there
Saw your trail in the snow
did you find the way to freedom

It's the last day I'm here
can you hear the sky fall down
Collapsing over ravaged ground

The sickness rising
the towering wall, going for the fire
Found the signs of the road I was looking for
Bend my desire and fade from their sight

The dents is all that I had
the tidings from our fading sun
Made me wiser

Take your time
everyone will want to go
Step by errant step

Degraded my heart
that's what you do when you have nothing more to find
Degraded my heart
that's what you do when you have nothing more to find

The dents is all that I had
the tidings from our fading sun
Made me wiser

So hey,
let's celebrate there's no need to cry
No one can comfort you there's no one around

But baby,
Can you hear the sky blowing at night
It's our wealth

And I'm ready to go if you're already there
Saw your trail in the snow
did you find the way to freedom

It's the last day I'm here
can you hear the sky fall down
Collapsing over ravaged ground

Well, these are the words that you won't find
This closure is not what you had in mind
Commemorate and relive the harm
The treason conclude

Lest we forgive what did bring us here
This closure is not what you had in mind
I try to remember you as it was, fragments

Ghost of different shades
cold day up ahead
I glide away into the dark
two hours till morning's due

And I wait here for you
to see you rise like the tide
Graced and admired

I fall away across the dark
It will inspire, fell inside

Touched upon deadened virtue
Made it burn through weights of courage
Conformed to all those already hidden
Their crystal ground

Steel made wall, see the barrier stand tall
Ascend through the air and find a heart yet undefined

Well, these are the words that you won't find
This closure is not what you had in mind
Commemorate and relive the harm
The treason conclude

Lest we forgive what did bring us here
This closure is not what you had in mind
I try to remember you as it was, fragments

Source of withering code of dust, of deceit
Can't proceed without a guide
Intuition abandoned you, I'm clouding the view

See you rise like the tide
Graced and admired
I fall away across the dark
It will inspire fell inside

Touched upon deadened virtue
Made it burn through weights of courage
Conformed to all those already hidden

Conformed to all those already hidden
Their crystal ground

My memories like deleted film
Awareness of this fire, kerosene
Ignite the trial of my mind

Above the horizon now
upon the freezing tracks
Grasp for the embers of my life
You came back but so did I

Who's in control
Spite, so cold in this light

Reflective summary froze me in a frame
My time had run out before the future came
Depart from insight, breach was made

How could I ever forget our days
I drown in silver, set to go
Unafraid into the blue, blue waves
Though I had hoped to hear your voice there

Last song before the fade

Who's in control
Spite, so cold in this light

Arise to other heights now
Make me transcend into your still heart
Beyond this world of stone
let me surrender to the streams of nought

Last song before the fade

Sick days behind me now
Winter wails through the chest
Dim the lights as I pass, will be no harm

Arise to other heights now
Make me transcend into your still heart
Beyond this world of stone
let me surrender to the streams of nought

Last song before the fade

Spiraling nights in the void
Weathered coat and a dagger
If I dream back my youth I can still hear you sing
A voice that will die on a mountain

And I fear that I've stayed here just a little too long

I had to go where you couldn't follow
In my weariness I still hear you singing in my mind

All the fortunes they took away

The shifting earth beneath us
Nothing to observe
The clouds at our feet
Nothing to observe

The sun was made a jewel
Nothing to observe
When at night it did sleep
Nothing to observe

Cast in a trench of fire
I can see the sky is a ceiling
And when my heart dies down
I am long gone on the fields of summer's green
Away from fall and famine

In my weariness I still hear you singing in my mind
All the fortunes they took away

The shifting earth beneath us
Nothing to observe
The clouds at our feet
Nothing to observe

The sun was made a jewel
Nothing to observe
When at night it did sleep

I am in every season
the one you have always known
Life did not reward you
So find your way to the river and let go

The shifting earth beneath us
Nothing to observe
The clouds at our feet
Nothing to observe

The sun was made a jewel
Nothing to observe
When at night it did sleep
Nothing to observe

I am ready to find the lost way to vanishing days
I write words void of worth, in my youth I will always stay
There's room for every lie they put on my shoulders
I let it inside

Inseparable growth marks us still
Abundance won't come, purge our will

Cut out and resign
Overtaken and left behind
It's in our racing hearts
the things we never let go of

They spill into my love

I'm thinking if torpor had left my soul, voices would sing
I would submit my heart to the sentiment within
and let go of the night that is abiding here

Old songs lost their grace
Send some light back to this place
There's room for every lie they put on my shoulders
I let it inside

Inseparable growth marks us still
Abundance won't come, purge our will

Purge our will

It's in our racing hearts
the things we never let go of

Cut out and resign
Overtaken and left behind
It's in our racing hearts
the things we never let go of

Abiding here

I'm thinking if torpor had left my soul, voices would sing
I would submit my heart to the sentiment within
and let go of the night that is abiding here

Our burden fell down
once shared but waged war on my mind
So told my love farewell now
No loyalty to find

When you vanish over the skies
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie
Was banished from this hurtful life
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife

Winter winds take flight
circling over my grave
A haunting voice amidst the trees
rising up across the sea

You vanish over the skies
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie
Was banished from this hurtful life
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife

You vanish over the skies
Survival, it was destined for your name
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie

Was banished from this hurtful life
Compassion, brings you here when the rain falls on mine
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife

You came in to my circle of trust, arriving late
You could have done better, but it's okay
Contemplating summer and what could have been

Who knows

But I fear you took the words from my drunken heart
and they're vanishing with you
Closing down, leaking my inactivated mind into you

Memorial
Let's put everything underground now
Your void eyes
How long until you come back around

5 A.M., I'm fading
Ghost on the pavement
I celebrate futility within
I am wretched, all colors blur to one

You did well to make me believe
It was a way to survive, to run a scar inside

Ascend now, as your chain of rust has swayed me
Observing dead air, so worn out
Contemplating summer and what could have been

Who knows

But I fear you took the words from my drunken heart
and they're vanishing with you
Closing down, leaking my inactivated mind into you

Memorial
Let's put everything underground now
Your void eyes
How long until you come back around

5 A.M., I'm fading
Ghost on the pavement
I celebrate futility within
You did well to make me believe
It was a way to survive

You took your gear and hit the trail
I was there by the runway
Above spires and buildings now
you have passed the horizon

In time another star will rise, dissimulation
On the wind comes the message now
you have passed the horizon
Divide like wings

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days
That's where our memories run

And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good

As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Oh no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no, say it isn't true
Can't take this pain and sorrow
Can't you see my heart is broken in two

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone

You stay out here in the snow
All night beside the road
But there's fire so keep warm
I'm leaving soon
It's bleak
And inside you can't hold your thoughts together
The slumber within a dreamer of stars
In a house of ash and scars
So many miles apart
And all we see is white tonight

Goodnight lover, sleep well
I'll get you here
I'll call early tomorrow
It's time for allies to rise

Are you in baby
The sunset is shattering
Time waits for no one

A winter song inside the heart
Won't you hear me when I call
It's time for you and me to fall

In times of surrender
I am shedding my scars
I was sick
But I was set for the stars
The robe wasn't mine
But I wore it still
In the sunset of age
On the weight of my limbs

Closed was the door to my past perception
And my disposition
Had then been changed
I opened my mind to all the love forsaken
You saw my white flag
You saw our shadows merge

Through tides of repentance
My words led to deed
In their wake
See how I sway
Eyes fixed on the horizon
Bleak as it seems
I let the words relapse
And return to a dream

Then glide into the night
All my memories unbroken
I let the raptors circle me
To become their only prey
I see the beast laying waste
I see his wings keep unfolding
His name strewn across the sky
And reflected on the world

This is my elegy for love
Their covenant
Gold for our blood

Came to stay in exile
Transmigration at a halt
I could not cross
I had no choice but to make peace
Reach higher ground
Every breath now without a sound
Every breath now without a sound

Rivers rush
Behind the blood
The cinder skies come alive
With this drop of sunset
How far can we go
Along the elusive flood
I've been waiting all of my life to be with you

Such as pale spark
Such a long wait
Before you would let me know
Before you would bless me with your thunder
The ground shakes
It carries the weight of the letting go
I can feel you tear me asunder
My love
I can feel you push and give way to drowning
I can feel you pierce my heart

Hammers thrust
Within the cells
You're a torch to the temple of depression
Saturnalian curse
These are my heaving words
I will do it all over again to be with you

Motionless now
Venin is in the blood
You're a preacher without a cross
Give me some trouble
Get me some trouble in
I can't wait
I can't wait again

My voice channeling
A circuit's end
The house we lived in
Stricken with blight
Finding ways to kill the pain
Let the river run wild
Dreams shattering
Aerial sound

Scrape the lacquer
Can't you see it's all tarnished

Tried the poise
To radiate
Tried my words
To illustrate
Finding ways to end the pain
I let the river run wild
Dreams shattering
Fixing to die

The levee breaking
I can't live to fight once more
The road to the grave is straight as an arrow
I'm just staying around to sing your song
Baby

My voice travelling
Soaring bird above your head
The house we lived in
Ridden with disease

Erased my plan
Had nothing better to do
Hollow sky
Dead to our collective eye
No rebellion
No hostility inside
Just indifference
A bit of quiet
And a slow descending curve
To keep you dreaming
Yeah
Of consolation

You drink my words in the wake of your sorrow
You walk beside me and it feels like a hundred years
The plans you make for the perpetual tomorrow
Will be collapsing still

This time I'm losing the battle
There are too many things to overcome

I seek respite
The comfort of apathy
Burial time
Submit to the non-divine

Did you see
The soot in my eyes
The long night
The spiralling lights
I'm so tired
The scars in my mind
It didn't end well
But you had me on fire

I navigate the dark
I bow before the flame I have deserted
Step off the map and let it go
Then focus on the fade

Stillness of the day
Renewal was the death of my ambition

To get higher
I have to go so low

Sold my worth
Made time for it
While I waited for something lasting
Until you would come running my way
To stay
But what does it matter now
It's the winter of our passing
Sold my trust
And my love too

Disregard the soul
Heart is made of mist
And still it's thinning
Bad news for you is we are fucked
And you don't know where we're heading next

The feeling that did remain
If we take some time to remember it
The feeling of what was good
Do you recall it at all

Drifting like wood
Our years
In the rivers of the aftermath
They shattered our right to wonder
Delivered us from free will
Our stories were thrown on the fire
Burning like bibles
They shattered our right to wonder
Exposed us to constraint

Hey
We're dead now
Affinity has been found below the ground
Beyond the heart's vow
The open road
Amnesia bound

Our carbon shells deserted
We came so far for nothing
Unsung
Fixed on dead grass

Who will remain
And wake up to the sound of sorrow

When your skies are clearing
When your battles are fought
When mercy returns
To all of your thoughts
Remember the carnage
The vanishers trail
Our souls of the sunset
Drifting away

Waiting for warmth
Endless the days
Argent haze
As the remedy flows into
Concealed veins

Where are we to run
Our season won't come
And everything you have said so far has been wrong

Algidity
It's late in the evening here
The wind dying down
The lights are leaning
No more sound

Read my lips, love
Fill your lungs with words
Lest we forget to explore
Bring back our revered dreams
Our month of May
Memories left my heart sore

White giants sleep
Along the roads
Our dead end tracks
In times as vile as these
I want us back

City glacier of sordid snow
Darkness comes in from the street and glides back out again
My voice is shifting ever so slow
The prints of my fingers sing upon your skin

So cruel your desire
It pulled me under
But the drapery of my eye won't fall
I lie in wait for the night to find you
Sepia teeth and claw

Hope was changing lanes
I had to turn
Changed my pace
Either way
I grew so old

This is how I disappear
Separated from the dead twin
No hound is on my trail now
Journey to the heart of your deceit
And defining my shed skin
With no one waiting
I am waiting for no one

Departure from the terminus
Arriving on the 4th
Weightless in the arms of none
Flick of the switch, my name lit up
Flickering in white, then gone

We're sundered
Our cards were dealt and what did you receive
In my rest
In all my coming nights
I will dream for you to see
And my words
Will be spilled upon the ground
And sorrow must be freed

Morning
At long last sleeping
No colours to wake me

How wild the wind came in
On the day when I found out
Passage of the one dead star
Its black dust lingering
Seeping through to my lungs
I fall towards the skyline
I drown my sorrows here
In liquids clear
Time for absolution
How the dead birds sing
They're right atop my roof

Take my offering
My promise can never be undone
The weight of midnight
Replaced by the shadow of a sun
I hold you in my arms
And it's farther than you've ever been
Little one

Adrift in sacred vertigo
The name is wandering
Our neon epitaph
Time for absolution
All the dead birds sing
They're right atop my roof

Shadow of my shadow
Cling not to my grief
I am long left behind now
You are free

There comes a time for all of us
To set our unfortunate sails
Our chance to part with the unrest
The open trail, the fever's crest

Will you meet me there
Underneath the pallid city lights
In the rain of Summerland
Over the ashes
Our memories in open hands

My words must levitate
And reverberate through the void
The nails are in, the pressure's there
The music of loss is in the air

Thought I saw you in the street
Standing still
Watching me
I would fall down on my knees
I would love to surrender to nothingness
But I'll stay another year
To see if things might change
Remain where you are
My love will protect you always

I keep the dogs at bay
With conscience free from sin
My eyes beyond the great cold absence
It's where my farthest love lies and waits

I feel the oceans coil
Feel the chemicals burn
I rest in the long arms of torpor
It's for the closing sky
That I yearn

Thoughts like vapor
Views of nothingness appear
Echo the labor
Await the unforgiving years

Can I have a change in my perspective now
Blue moves out of my range
A shift in this asperity
Love drifts away
A change of colors through my eyes
I had to let you go
The token of a strategy

Into the ultra void
In the sleeper's white nest
I dream in a damaged sequence
Of where my oldest love lies at rest

I feel the oceans coil
Feel the chemicals burn
I rest in the long arms of torpor
It's for the closing sky
That I yearn

Thoughts like vapor
Views of nothingness appear
Echo the labor
Await the unforgiving years

Do I ever change
Blue moves out of my range
And love drifts away
I had to let you go
Dissolving our analogy

Can I have a change in my perspective now
Blue moves out of my range
A shift in this asperity
Love drifts away
A change of colors through my eyes
I had to let you go
The token of a strategy

One man down
Five more left to go
Five more left to go

Look I told you so
We never stop
If we said that
We'll back it up
For sure
You know

We're fighters
We're fighters
We're fighters
We're fighters
We're fighters

If you fear the heat
You best be leaving
You gotta stand back
If you don't love the beating
For me and my crew
Don't play for keeps
We blow up
And clear the streets

I thought things would take off
But they cooled down
Your voice on the phone
I hear traffic behind

Violent rain
Outside looking out
Looking up
Fragments of sky
Looking to leave
Transmit and deceive
Kill off the fortune tellers

You say that woe is always on your mind
You drag me back in for a breath of comfort
No longer telling wrong from right
The ghostlike horizon of your eye

I hear things aren't well
Since you sold me out
I remember you clear
Your rituals of doubt
With city lights from 1988
Sprinkled like dust
On your window pane

You say that woe is always on your mind
You drag me back in for a breath of comfort
No longer telling wrong from right
The ghostlike horizon of your eye

Maelstrom
I'm drifting away
I'm staying under
You fall back to aged ideals
Controlled by thunder
Ruled by dishonour
Come feel
I am not real

Woe is always on your mind
You drag me back in for a breath of comfort
No longer telling wrong from right
The ghostlike horizon of your eye

We are gathered here tonight
His apostles in the moonlight
He's coming in
A foul saint coming marching in

Engineer of the colossal shade
This is us
Losing grip of the daylight
Letting go of the daylight

He is the voice of our demise
Spitting fire like a mountain
This is us

Let's drain the source
And trade it for the greater high
Just say the word
I'll give up my final piece of freedom
Collapse my mind
I'm ready for the crowning blow
Come what may
I'm ready to enjoy the treason

Satellite star
My future watching me
Transmitting scars
My future watching me

We are gathered here tonight
His apostles in the moonlight
He's coming in
A foul saint coming marching in

Engineer of the colossal shade
This is us
Losing grip of the daylight
Letting go of the daylight

Let's drain the source
And trade it for the greater high
Just say the word
I'll give up my final piece of freedom
Collapse my mind
I'm ready for the crowning blow
Come what may
I'm ready to enjoy the treason

See my scars
They come from the other half
The drowning god
My words are bouncing off the ground
I see them all around

But your back was turned
My heart had to learn
These years
What a theft
Forty-six now
How many left?

Recall the red sun burning
Over the avenues and into our view
Radiance that signified
Magnified
Divergent hue

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice in shadow now
Sowing seeds to segregate

Opaline
Saw the trail of the fleeting twin
Through last year's grass
With the curtain closing in a bit
I will go where I see fit

Love me not
For I was never one to pass the test, no
All for the best
You're heading east
If you go now
I go west

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice in shadow now
Sowing seeds to segregate

Gliding
Weightless
Through the vapour
Off the map and into loss
No more wisdom here to gather
No more boundaries to cross

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice in shadow now
Sowing seeds to segregate

I had a futile dream
It rose from loving you
But the debt has broken my back
There's no need to retaliate
As your train has left our track

I can't wait out
The longest journey
Must lose the grip
At the fingertip
I won't return
From the circumscription
Walking past the compass now
To forget my dream

Shut down my mind
Is the heart brave enough yet
Uncover the skies
And show me the birds
The birds
They rise
Premonitions of the other side

Time well spent
In the chapel of Eschaton
Smog of days through nights the same
Oh the spell is kicking in
I commend the dereliction
Last look at the cityscape
Before the change

Shut down my mind
Is the heart brave enough yet
Uncover the skies
And show me the birds
The birds
They rise
Premonitions of the other side

Follow the birds
Follow the birds

Follow the birds
Follow the birds

Shut down my mind
Is the heart brave enough yet
Uncover the skies
And show me the birds
The birds
They rise
Premonitions of the other side

Pale beats the heart of this bystander
Shutting down, fog on lens
A drab moon
To match my lowering standards
Suspended in deceptive light
Blind and reckless towards my own condition
Memorized the endless city

Woe to you my suspicion
Always there to say goodbye but come again

Low I go
Compromised
But never enough it seems
Low I go, go, go
Spiraling down
Have never enough to pay
I don't have the means to stay
Resilient

To see Saturn ascending
To trade my cold sharp nights
Oh, my beloved
To find you this evening
Oh, the prettiest eyes locked with mine

I have waited, waited, waited
Couldn't find another reason to live on
But you shake my blood like a raging sea
So I'm bound for the joy of sorrow
If you go there with me

Low I go
Compromised
But never enough it seems
Low I go, go, go
Spiraling down
Have never enough to pay
I don't have the means to stay
Resilient

Oh, just one more thing
I hope it doesn't go unnoticed that my body wants to sing
Oh, just one more thing
I hope it doesn't go unnoticed that my body needs to sing
With you

I have waited, waited, waited
Couldn't find another reason to live on
But you shake my blood like a raging sea
So I'm bound for the joy of sorrow
If you go there with me

Feel the future
Sift through your days
In your palace of wretched steel
See my absence as something good

Oh, grant your eyes a little rest
Turn your face towards your fortune
See my absence as something good

Author of scars
I see your hands upon my epitaph
Then you shift into a looking glass
A sky void of stars

Touch the concrete
Placed on my chest
And chain the songbirds to your argent dome
Confirm my fate as disposable

Oh, grant your eyes a little rest
Turn your face towards your fortune
And keep your promises negotiable

Author of scars
I see your hands upon my epitaph
Then you shift into a looking glass
A sky void of stars

It's shaking
My trembling howl
It's breaking
Overtaking

Author of scars
I see your hands upon my epitaph
Then you shift into a looking glass
A sky void of stars

Creator of flaws
I know you will be the last to laugh
Then you shift into a looking glass
A sky void of stars

I step outside to be defeated
Oh, I'm suspended by a parting thread
A fool awash with wine
Migrated far to be convicted
You sucked me in and you bled me dry
It's a song we need to cry

Even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die

I'm calculating our criterion
And listen hard for the note of serenity
But I didn't mind the heat
I remember well the contradictions
How you turned your face towards the city lights
And the shadow fell behind

Even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die

Even if we try Try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
Even if we try even if we try
We can't live forever
I gave you my shards of sky
But we can barely see the reflection
We'll just live to see the essence die

Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes

There's nothing quite like time to tell how it is
We all tremble neath the unforgiver
Terrified
But with no reason to show it yet
If we come to higher ground in the future
I will assure you that nothing was your fault
So take my chance to lose another battle
But feel nothing at all

Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes
And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct baby
I could have been yours

We are standing safe outside of knowledge
Where nothing ever can or will be taught
So take your right and throw it on the fire
Will change nothing at all

And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct baby
I could have been yours

You think it's summer
But it's not
It's deceiving your eyes and paralyzing mine
You change the course
You're overlooking your defence
Our tattered flag
It's reaching for your hands

But you shut your mind to it
You fixed spikes around my heart

Meet up at dusk
Out on the tracks
Quietly stare with poisoned eyes
And it's my turn
It's taking off again
It's time to find out what's on the back of my skin
Check your instinct baby
I could have been yours

Heart is running low
Vanquished and confined
As we walk through the corridor
Measuring the dark
Until the meter says we can't take no more

You feel good about it
You say
You need to feel good about it
Still ridden with spite
Language is defied
As we walk through the corridor

We sing to the night
Abolishing the promise
Our constellation is so far from reach
I'm fading from your sky
The shutdown is complete
You turned away despite my loving

Time is burning slow
You beckon on the way
As you walk through the exit door
While estimating the losses rising
The venom in the glass says I need more
Yeah

You still feel good about it
You say
You need to feel good about it
Still ridden with spite
Language is defied
As we walk through the corridor

We sing to the night
Abolishing the promise
Our constellation is so far from reach
I touched your ember with a little bit of my wing
I'm fading from your sky
The shutdown is complete
You turned away despite my loving

In a room, Marriott, New York
Checking in to be held by you
Then checking out
Direction is shuffled back to nil
Caught in your maze still

We sing to the night
Abolishing the promise
Our constellation is so far from reach
I touched your ember with a little bit of my wing
I'm fading from your sky
The shutdown is complete
You turned away despite my loving

That star used to shine
But it fell below the line
Dropped under my eyes
Thrown to the old shade
And shall never live again

In the parlour of dusk, inception of suspense
Channeling words to trouble the quiet
Surrender into the dark spread of a wing
It's visible now how our past freedom turns to dust

Approaching our departure
No solace in our call
Scattered across the skyline
No beacon to illuminate our fall

No dreaming back to everlasting light
No dreaming back to everlasting light

I arm my dead mind
With the final reason
Will sell it to the lowest bidder
My final reason

I arm my dead mind
With the final reason
Will sell it to the lowest bidder
My final reason

I arm my dead mind
With the final reason
Will sell it to the lowest bidder
My final reason

It won't matter if you get back beneath my hand
No black magic ever enough to command

Approaching our departure
No solace in our call
Scattered across the skyline
No beacon to illuminate our fall

Sedated
Turning myself in
Complicated
The more you hurt
The more I love you
Vacated
The sickness tears my skin
Terminated
The more you hurt
The more I love you

Spent
Can't undo
Nausea divine
Drifting off from life
And won't
Make it back

Check my pulse
Listen close to the evening grow
What's the perspective like?
I'm trying to control it

Staying wired
All set up
To be purged again
Oh, I'm the absconder, searching for respite

I thought I had it all figured out
Spilled my cold heart onto the asphalt
Made sure my reasons for sorrow would remain
Did let the lack of serotonin define my name
When I all ever wanted was to make you smile again

Soaring words
To invoke the starless energy
But I'm long since gone
I'm wasted, baby

Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
I'm reaching for oblivion

Constant need to depart
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure
Constant need to depart I'm reaching for oblivion
And slip through the cracks of the divine closure Let me rest my heart in the quiet of the dark

I thought I had it all figured out
Spilled my cold heart onto the asphalt
Made sure my reasons for sorrow would remain
Did let the lack of serotonin define my name
When I all ever wanted was to make you smile again
